# Minist-Digits-Recognizer-in-C\
## 📌 Introduction:\
![Digits Minist](res/digits.png)\
* The MNIST dataset is one of the most popular benchmark datasets in machine learning and deep learning.
* It consists of 42,031 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), where each image is 28x28 pixels.
* Test set: 42,031 * 0.2 = 8406 images | Training set: 33,625 images | Classes: 10 (digits 0 to 9).\
## 🎯 Objective:\
+ Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify handwritten digits from MNIST.
+ Understand the dataset, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
+ A fully connected neural network implemented from scratch in C trained on the MNIST digit dataset.\
